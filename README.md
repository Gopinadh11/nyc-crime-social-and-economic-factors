DS 670 : Capstone Big data and data analytics 


Introduction :

Urban metropolitans, huge cities like New York City (NYC), face multiple issues that significantly impact public safety, economic well-being, and community welfare. Crime and motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) are some of the problems that occur frequently and have severe consequences. Historically, these incidents have been examined individually, sometimes disregarding potential connections spurred by socioeconomic factors. This literature review synthesizes recent studies in urban crime, MVCs, and socioeconomic determinantsâ€”demographic, social, economic, and housing determinants highlighting the potential of an integrated analytical framework for enhancing policy-making and urban management.
In this project we are going show what is the impact of  social and economic factors in crime that are happening in Newyork city. We will use machine
learning models to predict a crime that might take place in a particular place.
